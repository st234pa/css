    <h1>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</h1>
    <p>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
    <p>He taught me a code. To survive. <strong> You look…perfect.</strong> <em> I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</em> Hello, Dexter Morgan.</p>
    <h2>Tell him time is of the essence.</h2>
    <p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I'm partial to air conditioning.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li><li>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</li><li>You look…perfect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</h3>
    <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You look…perfect.</p>

    <p>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p><br>
