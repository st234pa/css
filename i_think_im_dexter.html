    <h1>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</h1>
    <p>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
    <p>He taught me a code. To survive. <strong> You look…perfect.</strong> <em> I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</em> Hello, Dexter Morgan.</p>
    <h2>Tell him time is of the essence.</h2>
    <p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I'm partial to air conditioning.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li><li>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</li><li>You look…perfect.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</h3>
    <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You look…perfect.</p>

    <p>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
    <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Only you could make those words cute. God created pudding, and then he rested. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
    <p>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. You're a killer. I catch killers. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
    <p>I have a dark side, too. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
    <p>I like seafood. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm partial to air conditioning.</p>
    <p>God created pudding, and then he rested. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</p>
    <p>Like a sloth. I can do that. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>
    <p>This man is a knight in shining armor. I have a dark side, too. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
    <p>I am not a killer. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
    <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! He taught me a code. To survive. I'm partial to air conditioning. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
    <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
